## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pitou, a passionate Web Developer with a love for coding and a flair for innovation. My mission is to turn coffee into code and ideas into elegant solutions.

### ðŸ”­ What I'm up to

Currently, I'm diving deep into Backend Development. I'm on a quest to master the art of Full Stack Development, and you can follow my journey through my repositories.

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning

I never settle for mediocrity! Right now, I'm expanding my skills in NodeJS and exploring the wonders of MongoDB. Every line of code is a step towards mastery.

### ðŸ’¡ Fun fact

I believe that coding is like artâ€”it's not just about what you create, but the elegance with which you do it. When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the world, whether it's conquering peaks in hiking boots or diving into the pages of a sci-fi novel. And here's a fun fact: Did you know that the average smartphone today has more computing power than the computers used for the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969? ðŸŒ•ðŸš€ Talk about pocket-sized moonshot technology! ðŸ“±ðŸ’»
